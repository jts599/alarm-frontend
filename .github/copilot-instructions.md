# Copilot Instructions for alarm-frontend

## Project Overview
This is the Alarm Frontend project - a web application for managing and displaying alarm systems.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend framework: (To be determined based on project needs)
- Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (assumed)
- Build tools: (To be determined)

## Code Style and Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variables and functions
  - Use PascalCase for classes and components
  - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### Code Organization
- Organize files by feature or functionality
- Keep related code together
- Separate concerns (UI, business logic, data access)

### Best Practices
- Write modular, reusable code
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate user inputs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid magic numbers and strings - use named constants
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Ensure tests are deterministic and independent
- Aim for high code coverage
- Mock external dependencies in tests

## Security
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities

## Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex functions
- Keep README up to date with setup and usage instructions
- Document architectural decisions
- Include examples in documentation

## Git and Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches for development
- Review code before merging

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Provide appropriate ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain good color contrast ratios

## Performance
- Optimize for fast load times
- Minimize bundle size
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Use caching strategically

## When Suggesting Code
- Prefer modern, idiomatic code patterns
- Suggest using existing libraries over reinventing solutions
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Provide complete, working examples
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
